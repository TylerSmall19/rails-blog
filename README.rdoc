== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

I don't really have many things to say about this blog, but to get it running:

* <tt>$ bundle install</tt>
* <tt>$ bundle exec rake db:setup</tt>
* <tt>$ rails server</tt>
* Browse to localhost:3000
